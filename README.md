## This python project is very basic due to my developing skills in coding

## It assumes that you have a full size Pimoroni Unicorn Hat connected to a RaspberryPi through GPIO
## but should work with a unicorn Phat as wel due to the unicorn.set_layout(unicorn.AUTO) in the code

## Note, this code has only been tested on a Pi Zero W but should work on all Pi's

## All Unicorn hat repositories must be installed from https://github.com/pimoroni/unicorn-hat for this to function.
